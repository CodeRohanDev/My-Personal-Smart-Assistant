              "text": "This Python code snippet demonstrates a simple function to add two numbers and then prompts the user for input to use the function. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:\n\n**1. Function Definition:**\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(num1, num2):\n  \"\"\"Adds two numbers and returns the sum.\n\n  Args:\n    num1: The first number.\n    num2: The second number.\n\n  Returns:\n    The sum of num1 and num2.\n  \"\"\"\n  return num1 + num2\n```\n\n* **`def add_numbers(num1, num2):`**:  This line defines a function named `add_numbers`. The parentheses `()` enclose the parameters the function takes (`num1` and `num2`).\n* **Docstring:** The triple quotes `\"\"\" \"\"\"` contain a docstring, which is used to document the function. It explains what the function does, what arguments it takes, and what it returns.\n* **`return num1 + num2`**: This line performs the addition of `num1` and `num2` and returns the result back to the part of the code that called the function.\n\n**2. User Input:**\n\n```python\n# Get input from the user\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n```\n\n* **`input(\"Enter the first number: \")`**: This line displays the message \"Enter the first number: \" to the user and waits for them to type something and press Enter. The text entered by the user is captured as a string.\n* **`float(input(...))`**:  The `float()` function converts the input string to a floating-point number, allowing for decimal values.\n* **`num1 = ...` and `num2 = ...`**: The converted numbers are stored in the variables `num1` and `num2`.\n\n**3. Calculating the Sum:**\n\n```python\n# Calculate the sum\nsum = add_numbers(num1, num2)\n```\n\n* **`sum = add_numbers(num1, num2)`**: This line calls the `add_numbers` function, passing the values stored in `num1` and `num2` as arguments. The function executes, calculates the sum, and returns it. The returned value is then stored in the `sum` variable.\n\n**4. Printing the Result:**\n\n```python\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The sum of\", num1, \"and\", num2, \"is:\", sum)\n```\n\n* **`print(...)`**: This line uses the `print` function to display the final result.  The output will look like this:\n   ```\n   The sum of 5.2 and 3.8 is: 9.0\n   ``` \n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Functions:** Reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.  They make your programs more organized and easier to maintain.\n* **Arguments:** Values passed to a function when it's called.\n* **Return Values:** Functions can send back a result using the `return` keyword. \n* **User Input:** The `input()` function allows programs to interact with users and obtain information from them.\n* **Data Types:**  Python has different data types like integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), and strings (`str`).  The `float()` function is used to convert strings to numbers. \n\nLet me know if you have any more questions or would like to explore other Python concepts! \n",

Prepare the dough:**\n\n* In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt.\n* Gradually add the water, mixing with your hands to form a soft dough.\n* Knead the dough for 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic. \n* Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 15-20 minutes.\n\n**2. Make the dal filling:**\n\n* Rinse the moong dal in a sieve and soak it in water for 30 minutes. \n* Drain the dal and transfer it to a pot. Add 1 cup of water, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt.\n* Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the dal is cooked through but not mushy.\n* While the dal simmers, heat the oil in a pan over medium heat. \n* Add the cumin seeds and mustard seeds. Once they start to splutter, add the chopped onion and green chili (if using). \n* Cook until the onion is softened, about 5 minutes.\n* Add the cooked dal and chopped cilantro to the pan. Stir to combine.\n* Mash the dal slightly with a potato masher or fork, leaving some chunks. \n* Season with additional salt if needed. \n\n**3. Shape the rotis:**\n\n* Divide the dough into 8 equal portions.\n* Roll each portion into a ball.\n* On a lightly floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll out each ball into a thin circle, about 6-7 inches in diameter.\n* Place a spoonful of the dal filling in the center of each roti, leaving a border around the edges. \n* Fold the edges of the roti over the filling, pleating or pinching them together to create a pouch.\n\n**4. Cook the rotis:**\n\n* Heat a flat griddle or tawa over medium heat.\n* Place a roti on the griddle and cook for 1-2 minutes per side, or until lightly golden brown and slightly puffy. \n* Repeat with remaining rotis.\n\n**5. Serve:**\n\n* Serve the dal rotis hot, garnished with fresh cilantro sprigs if desired.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* If the dough is too dry, add a little more water, a teaspoon at a time. \n* If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour, a tablespoon at a time.\n* For a richer flavor, add a pinch of asafoetida (hing) to the oil when tempering the dal filling.\n* You can also add other vegetables like chopped potatoes, carrots, or spinach to the dal filling.\n\nEnjoy your delicious homemade dal rotis!",
